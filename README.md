# re-actions

## Basic Overview
Re-Actions is a application that utilizes the GitHub Action to ensure that certain quality checks are met prior to merging to important branches such as main. Before the project code was added, a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions was created to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, and the application is deployed when code is merged from develop to the main branch.
